# MinHash Sketching for Large-Scale Set Similarity Computation

## Introduction
MinHash is a probabilistic data structure used to estimate the similarity between two sets efficiently. This project implements MinHash sketching and its application in computing Jaccard similarity for large datasets.

## Features
- Generate MinHash signatures for datasets.
- Compute Jaccard similarity using MinHash.
- Scalable for large datasets with efficient hashing and signature comparison.

## How It Works
1. **Set Representation**: Each set is represented by its elements (e.g., user activities, document shingles).
2. **Hashing**: Multiple hash functions are applied to create signatures for the sets.
3. **Signature Comparison**: The similarity between two sets is estimated by comparing their MinHash signatures.
4. **Jaccard Similarity**: Defined as the ratio of intersection to union of two sets, approximated using MinHash.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abbasmirza10/minhash-sketching.git
   cd minhash-sketching
   ```

## Applications
- Duplicate detection in large datasets.
- Document similarity in search engines.
- Recommendation systems.
- Social network analysis.
